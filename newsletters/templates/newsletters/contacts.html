            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I have been working with ceramics for many years. When I first saw the potter at the wheel as a child, I was enchanted! But my steps after high school went in a different direction, to the office. That's when it dawned on me, I don't want to write out tables and make coffee! I want to create mugs that someone else brews coffee into. And so ceramics called me and I listened. And really, in the end I'm sitting here in a dirty apron, dirt behind my fingernails, but I'm right here, this is where I want to be. </p>
            <p>The products are either modeled by hand or dialed on a circle, each piece is an original. Nowhere else will you find such a sprite lounging in your garden.

                Ceramics for the kitchen is not only a practical helper, but also decorates your counter or sideboard. For it, I have certificates for materials in contact with foodstuffs from ZÃš. Of course, you can put all ceramics in the dishwasher.</p>

These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
