            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I have been working with ceramics for many years. When I first saw the potter at the wheel as a child, I was enchanted! But my steps after high school went in a different direction, to the office. That's when it dawned on me, I don't want to write out tables and make coffee! I want to create mugs that someone else brews coffee into. And so ceramics called me and I listened. And really, in the end I'm sitting here in a dirty apron, dirt behind my fingernails, but I'm right here, this is where I want to be. </p>
            <p>The products are either modeled by hand or dialed on a circle, each piece is an original. Nowhere else will you find such a sprite lounging in your garden.

                Ceramics for the kitchen is not only a practical helper, but also decorates your counter or sideboard. For it. Of course, you can put all ceramics in the dishwasher.</p>
